Welcome! I am Jihao Zhang, a recent graduate from [MSc Quantitative Finance](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/natural-sciences-and-mathematics/quantitative-finance.html) at Universität Zürich and ETH Zürich. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Economics at Wuhan University. 

Besides, I am a professional speedcuber and I will be joining the 2024 European Championship and 2024 Asian Championship. You can find my personal website at the [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016ZHAJ09).
